# DartBoard

![logo_trans.png](logo_trans.png)

DartBoard is a cross-platform code visualization tool.
It has most of the benefits of the modern IDEs, **but**
you don't need to install it!

This is how it works:

- DartBoard takes your Dart/Flutter codebase.
- And generates a static web-site,
- That you can then just send to your supervisor doesn't
  have Dart env installed on their computer.
