# DartBoard

![img_2.png](logo.png)

DartBoard is a cross-platform code visualization tool.
It has most of the benefits of the modern IDEs, **but**
you don't need to install it!

This is how it works:

- DartBoard takes your Dart/Flutter codebase.
- It then processes it into a static web-site,
- That you can then just send to your supervisor who doesn't
  even need to have Dart env installed on their computer.
